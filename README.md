# Music-Composer
Music Composer can (optionally mind read to) create songs.  Currently set to generate song elements randomly, not mind read them, so doesn't require precautions to run.

Install and load by typing ['mindreadtestmusiccomposer'].

Run with sectest0(Form1,Lyrics,Melody,Harmony),writeln([sectest0(Form1,Lyrics,Melody,Harmony)]).
