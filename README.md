# Music-Composer
Music Composer can (optionally mind read to) create songs.  Currently set to randomly generate song elements, not mind read them, so doesn't require precautions to run.

Install and load by typing ['mindreadtestmusiccomposer'].

Run with sectest0(Form1,Lyrics,Melody,Harmony),writeln([sectest0(Form1,Lyrics,Melody,Harmony)]).
